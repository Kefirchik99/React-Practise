React practice


Here I will post my practice in React.

1) The first app is a simple box-clicker that helped me understand how to use map without modifying state directly.

2) The second app is a simple one-liner that uses the ternary operator to display a message based on the conditions specified.

3) The third app is an app that shows the punchline of a joke (if it has one) and changes the button text.

4) The meme generator is a simple app that uses an external API and the useEffect hook. You can change the image text and generate new memes.
